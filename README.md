## MEGABYTE - Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07185">MEGABYTE</a>, Predicting Million-byte Sequences with Multiscale Transformers, in Pytorch. Took the liberty to generalize it even further so one can have multiple local models.

<a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/simple-hierarchical-transformer">Similar independent research that is a further generalization</a>

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://stability.ai/">Stability</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/">ðŸ¤— Huggingface</a> for the generous sponsorship to work on and open source cutting edge artificial intelligence research

## Install

```bash
$ pip install MEGABYTE-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from MEGABYTE_pytorch import MEGABYTE

model = MEGABYTE(
    num_tokens = 16000,             # number of tokens
    dim = (512, 256),               # transformer model dimension (512 for coarsest, 256 for fine in this example)
    max_seq_len = (1024, 4),        # sequence length for global and then local. this can be more than 2
    depth = (6, 4),                 # number of layers for global and then local. this can be more than 2, but length must match the max_seq_len's
    dim_head = 64,                  # dimension per head
    heads = 8,                      # number of attention heads
    flash_attn = True               # use flash attention
)

x = torch.randint(0, 16000, (1, 1024, 4))

loss = model(x, return_loss = True)
loss.backward()

# then after much training

logits = model(x)

# and sample from the logits accordingly
# or you can use the generate function

sampled = model.generate(temperature = 0.9, filter_thres = 0.9) # (1, 1024, 4)
```

## Test

Train on character-level enwik8 with patches of size 4

```bash
$ python train.py
```
